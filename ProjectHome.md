# About TurningPolyhedron #

TurningPolyhedron `[` _Windows only, sorry :( If you want to port it to Linux (possibly C++ with OGRE) or have any plan or idea, please contact me_ `]`, which is still in alpha stage, is a 3D enhancement to TurningSquare.

**News!**

  * Alpha version 0.0.1-2, fixed some bad bugs in 0.0.1-1. [Here](http://code.google.com/p/turningpolyhedron/downloads/detail?name=TurningPolyhedron_0.0.1-2.7z&can=2&q=) is the binary and [here](http://code.google.com/p/turningpolyhedron/downloads/detail?name=TurningPolyhedronSrc_0.0.1-2.7z&can=2&q=) is the source code.
  * Alpha version 0.0.1-1 is released! Currently only cuboid blocks is (partially) implemented :( [Here](http://code.google.com/p/turningpolyhedron/downloads/detail?name=TurningPolyhedron0.0.1-1.7z&can=2&q=) is the binary and [here](http://code.google.com/p/turningpolyhedron/downloads/detail?name=TurningPolyhedronSrc_0.0.1-1.7z&can=2&q=) is the source code. You can also checkout the latest SVN code.

Some new features plan to do:

  * Direct3D graphics
  * more tiles
  * Not only cuboid blocks, but also polyhedron
  * multi controllable blocks, different block properties
  * Various winning condition
  * Script (Lua) support
  * and so on ...
